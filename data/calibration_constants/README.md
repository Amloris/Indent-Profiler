The calibation data that describes system misalignment is stored here.

This data is used to help convert raw scans into corrected scans that take
into account system misalignment and wire bow. It is vital to correct for 
these errors prior to extracting indent parameters.

Only one valid set of calibration constants may exist in this directory at 
any given time.
