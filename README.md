# Indent-Profiler
A laser scanning system jointly developed by KSU and AMI to profile indented wires used in prestressed concrete.

### To Do
	Calibration:
	  1.) Calculate measurement uncertainty from corrected precision cylinders.
      2.) Using this uncertainty, eliminate outliers that violate stdev bounds.
	  3.) Add documentation file that describes scanner uncertainty.

	fileIO:
	  1.) Modify default paths for GetDir() and GetFile() to be relative
	  2.) Make sure file handling can run on Windows/Unix systems
