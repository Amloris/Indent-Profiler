A laser scanning system jointly developed by KSU and AMI to profile indented wires used in prestressed concrete.

###To Do
Calibration:
-Calculate measurement uncertainty from calibrated, corrected cylinders.
-Using this uncertainty, eliminate outliers that violate stdev bounds.
-Add documentation file that describes scanner uncertainty.
