# Indent-Profiler
A laser scanning system jointly developed by KSU and AMI to profile indented wires used in prestressed concrete.

### To Do
	Calibration:
	  1.) Calculate measurement uncertainty from calibrated, corrected cylinders.
      2.) Using this uncertainty, eliminate outliers that violate stdev bounds.
	  3.) Add documentation file that describes scanner uncertainty.
